# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix type errors in the user restaurant notification hook and restaurant service files in a React Native (Expo) food delivery application.

## Key Knowledge
- Project is a mobile application called "Food Rush" built with React Native (Expo)
- Project directory: `/home/tochukwu/mobile-apps/food-rush`
- The application has both customer and restaurant user types
- Uses TypeScript for type checking
- Key files identified: 
  - `src/hooks/restaurant/useRestaurantNotifications.ts` (notification hook)
  - `src/services/restaurant/restaurantNotificationService.ts` (notification service)
- Uses zustand for state management
- Uses expo-notifications for handling push notifications

## Recent Actions
- Identified that the specified files had line terminator issues causing TypeScript compilation errors
- Rewrote both files (`useRestaurantNotifications.ts` and `restaurantNotificationService.ts`) with proper formatting and line breaks
- Verified that the specific type errors in these files were resolved
- Discovered that while the target files were fixed, there are still numerous other TypeScript errors throughout the codebase

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fix line terminator issues in useRestaurantNotifications.ts hook file
2. [DONE] Fix line terminator issues in restaurantNotificationService.ts service file
3. [DONE] Verify that the fixes resolve the specific TypeScript compilation errors in those files

Note: While the specific files requested have been fixed, there remain extensive TypeScript errors throughout the codebase that would require additional work to fully resolve.
