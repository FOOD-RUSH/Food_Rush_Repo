# Logout and RootNavigator Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Restaurant Profile Logout Button
**Problem**: The logout button in the restaurant profile screen only showed an alert but didn't actually perform logout.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `handleLogout` function to use the AuthStore's `logoutUser` method
- Added proper loading states during logout process
- Added Toast notifications for user feedback
- Integrated with the comprehensive app reset functionality

### 2. AuthStore Logout Function Enhancement
**Problem**: The original logout function only cleared tokens and auth state, but didn't clear other stores like cart data.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `logoutUser` function to clear all relevant stores (Auth, Cart, App)
- Added proper error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Preserved onboarding completion and user type selection
- Added loading states for better UX

### 3. RootNavigator User Type Handling
**Problem**: Potential race conditions and inconsistencies between AuthStore and AppStore user types.

**Solution**:
- Made AuthStore the primary source of truth for user type
- Added automatic synchronization between AuthStore and AppStore
- Improved `getInitialRouteName` function with better edge case handling
- Added loading states for auth operations
- Enhanced logging for debugging navigation decisions

### 4. App Reset Utilities
**Problem**: No centralized way to handle app resets, leading to inconsistent behavior.

**Solution**:
- Created `src/utils/appReset.ts` with comprehensive reset utilities
- Added functions for different reset scenarios:
  - `performCompleteAppReset`: Full app reset with options
  - `switchUserType`: Switch between customer/restaurant modes
  - `clearSessionData`: Clear only session data
  - `performEmergencyReset`: Nuclear option for unrecoverable states

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/stores/customerStores/AuthStore.ts`
- Enhanced `logoutUser` function to use centralized app reset utility
- Added better error handling and loading states
- Improved fallback mechanisms

### 2. `src/screens/restaurant/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- Imported AuthStore hooks (`useAuthStore`, `useAuthLoading`)
- Replaced dummy logout alert with actual logout functionality
- Added loading states to logout button
- Added Toast notifications for user feedback

### 3. `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`
- Added AuthStore as primary source for user type
- Implemented automatic synchronization between stores
- Enhanced `getInitialRouteName` with better edge case handling
- Added loading states for auth operations
- Improved logging for debugging

### 4. `src/utils/appReset.ts` (New File)
- Centralized app reset utilities
- Multiple reset strategies for different scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling
- Preserves important state like onboarding completion

### 5. `src/utils/__tests__/appReset.test.ts` (New File)
- Unit tests for app reset utilities
- Ensures reliability of logout functionality

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
- ✅ Logout button now actually logs out users
- ✅ Loading states during logout process
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback
- ✅ Smooth transitions between user types
- ✅ Proper app state reset

### Code Quality
- ✅ Centralized app reset logic
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Consistent state management
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Unit tests for critical functionality

### Reliability
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for failed operations
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases
- ✅ Prevention of race conditions
- ✅ Proper cleanup of all stores

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test logout from restaurant profile screen
   - Verify app resets to Auth screen
   - Check that cart is cleared after logout
   - Test switching between user types
   - Verify onboarding state is preserved

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test logout when network is offline
   - Test logout with corrupted token storage
   - Test rapid user type switching
   - Test app state after force-closing during logout

3. **Performance**:
   - Verify logout doesn't cause memory leaks
   - Check navigation performance after reset
   - Monitor store hydration after logout

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics**: Add logout event tracking
2. **Security**: Add logout confirmation for sensitive operations
3. **Offline**: Handle logout when offline
4. **Multi-device**: Implement logout from all devices
5. **Session Management**: Add automatic logout on token expiry

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible and enhance existing functionality.
