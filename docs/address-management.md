# Address Management System Documentation

## Overview

The address management system in the food delivery app allows customers to store, manage, and select delivery addresses. This system is crucial for a food delivery service as it directly impacts the user experience and delivery efficiency.

## Current Implementation

### Address Data Structure

The address system uses a simple data model:

```typescript
interface AddressData {
  id?: string;
  label: string; // e.g., "Home", "Office"
  fullAddress: string; // Complete address text
  isDefault?: boolean; // Whether this is the default address
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Address Listing**
   - View all saved addresses in a scrollable list
   - Visual distinction for the default address
   - Address labels for easy identification

2. **Address Creation**
   - Add new addresses with custom labels
   - Enter full address details in a text field
   - Option to set as default address

3. **Address Editing**
   - Modify existing address information
   - Change address label
   - Update full address text
   - Toggle default address status

4. **Address Deletion**
   - Remove addresses that are no longer needed
   - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
   - Default address cannot be deleted (UI restriction)

5. **Default Address Handling**
   - One address can be marked as default
   - Default address is pre-selected in checkout
   - Visual indicator for default address in listings

### User Interface Components

1. **Address Screen**
   - Main screen for viewing all addresses
   - Floating action button for adding new addresses
   - List of address cards with edit/delete options

2. **Address Edit Modal**
   - Form for creating or editing addresses
   - Input fields for label and full address
   - Toggle for default address setting
   - Save/cancel actions

## User Flow

1. User accesses the Address screen from the Profile section
2. User views list of saved addresses
3. User can:
   - Add a new address by tapping the "+" FAB
   - Edit an existing address by tapping the edit icon
   - Delete a non-default address by tapping the delete icon
4. When adding/editing:
   - User enters a label (e.g., "Home", "Office")
   - User enters the full address details
   - User can optionally set as default
   - User saves the address
5. The address list updates to reflect changes

## Limitations of Current Implementation

1. **Text-Based Addresses**
   - Addresses are stored as plain text strings
   - No structured address components (street, city, postal code, etc.)
   - No validation of address format or completeness

2. **No Geocoding Integration**
   - Addresses are not linked to geographic coordinates
   - No map visualization of addresses
   - No distance calculation to restaurants

3. **Limited Address Selection in Checkout**
   - Checkout screen shows a placeholder address
   - No actual address selection from saved addresses
   - No ability to add a new address during checkout

4. **No Address Verification**
   - No validation that addresses are deliverable
   - No integration with local postal or geographic databases
   - No suggestions or autocomplete for address entry

5. **Basic UI**
   - Simple list-based interface
   - No visual mapping of addresses
   - No categorization beyond labels

## Requirements for Enhanced Address System

### For MVP in Yaounde

1. **Structured Address Input**
   - Separate fields for key address components:
     - Street address
     - Neighborhood/Quarter (important for Yaounde)
     - City (Yaounde)
     - Region (Centre)
     - Special landmarks or directions

2. **Geocoding Integration**
   - Convert addresses to geographic coordinates
   - Store latitude/longitude with each address
   - Enable distance calculations to restaurants

3. **Map Integration**
   - Visual representation of saved addresses
   - Map-based address selection
   - Pin placement for new addresses

4. **Address Verification**
   - Basic validation for required fields
   - Integration with local geographic data if available
   - Suggestions based on neighborhood/quarter

5. **Improved Checkout Integration**
   - Address selection during checkout
   - Ability to add new address during checkout
   - Visual confirmation of delivery location

## Technical Considerations

### Geocoding Services

For Cameroon/Yaounde, potential geocoding services include:

1. **Google Maps Geocoding API**
   - Comprehensive coverage
   - Accurate results
   - Paid service with quotas

2. **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**
   - Free and open source
   - Community-maintained data
   - May have limited coverage in some areas

3. **Local Geographic Services**
   - Cameroon-specific geographic data services
   - Potentially more accurate for local areas
   - May require partnerships

### Data Storage

The current implementation stores addresses in component state. For a production system, consider:

1. **Persistent Storage**
   - Save addresses to device storage using AsyncStorage or MMKV
   - Sync with backend when available

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Store addresses on server for cross-device access
   - User account association
   - Backup and restore capabilities

### Privacy Considerations

1. **Location Data Handling**
   - Clear privacy policy regarding address data
   - User control over location data sharing
   - Secure storage of geographic coordinates

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only collect necessary address information
   - Clear deletion options for user data

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Text-Based System
1. Add structured address input fields
2. Implement basic address validation
3. Improve address display in UI
4. Connect address selection to checkout

### Phase 2: Geocoding Integration
1. Integrate with selected geocoding service
2. Store geographic coordinates with addresses
3. Calculate distances to restaurants
4. Implement basic map visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Address autocomplete/suggestions
2. Enhanced map integration
3. Delivery zone validation
4. Address sharing capabilities

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Address Card Design**
   - Include map thumbnail if possible
   - Show relative distance to common locations
   - Better visual hierarchy for address components

2. **Input Experience**
   - Auto-detection of current location
   - Smart defaults based on user location
   - Clear error messaging for invalid addresses

3. **Checkout Integration**
   - Prominent address selection component
   - Visual confirmation of selected address
   - Quick access to edit or add addresses

## Conclusion

The current address management system provides basic functionality but lacks the geographic intelligence necessary for an effective food delivery service. Enhancing this system with geocoding capabilities and structured address input will significantly improve the user experience and operational efficiency of the food delivery service in Yaounde.
