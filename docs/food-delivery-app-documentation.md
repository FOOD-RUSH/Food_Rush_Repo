## Geolocation and Address Management

### Current Implementation

The app currently has a basic address management system that stores addresses as text strings without geographic coordinates.

### Required Enhancements

For a complete food delivery experience in Yaounde, the following geolocation features are essential:

1. **Address Geocoding**: Convert text-based addresses to geographic coordinates
2. **Reverse Geocoding**: Convert geographic coordinates to readable addresses
3. **Location Permissions**: Request and manage location permissions from users
4. **Map Integration**: Visual representation of locations within the app

### Address Data Structure

Enhanced address model to include geographic information:

```typescript
interface AddressData {
  id?: string;
  label: string; // e.g., "Home", "Office"
  fullAddress: string; // Complete address text
  isDefault?: boolean; // Whether this is the default address
  latitude?: number; // Geographic coordinate
  longitude?: number; // Geographic coordinate
  neighborhood?: string; // Yaounde-specific field
  deliveryZone?: string; // For delivery validation
}
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Basic geocoding integration with Google Maps Geocoding API
2. **Phase 2**: Map integration for visual address selection
