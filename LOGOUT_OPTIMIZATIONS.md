# Logout Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Logout Events**
- **Problem**: Logout function was being called multiple times, causing repeated navigation and store clearing
- **Solution**: Added state check to prevent multiple logout calls when user is already logged out
- **Result**: Single logout event emission, cleaner logs

### 2. **Inefficient Store Clearing**
- **Problem**: Logout was clearing all stores including addresses, payments, notifications, etc.
- **Solution**: Simplified to only clear essential stores (cart and user type)
- **Result**: Faster logout process, reduced bundle loading

### 3. **Multiple Event Listeners**
- **Problem**: Navigation was creating multiple logout event listeners
- **Solution**: Added ref-based listener management to ensure only one listener exists
- **Result**: Single navigation event, no duplicate handling

### 4. **Text Component Error**
- **Problem**: String interpolation in UserTypeSelectionScreen wasn't wrapped in Text component
- **Solution**: Wrapped the dynamic text content in proper Text component
- **Result**: No more "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" errors

### 5. **Cart Reminder Spam**
- **Problem**: Cart reminders were being cancelled multiple times during logout
- **Solution**: Added cancellation state management and early returns for empty reminder lists
- **Result**: Single "All cart reminders cancelled" log message

## Performance Improvements

### **Bundle Loading Optimization**
- Reduced from 7+ store imports to 2 essential imports during logout
- Eliminated unnecessary store clearing operations
- Faster logout completion time

### **Memory Management**
- Prevented memory leaks from multiple event listeners
- Cleaner state management during logout process
- Reduced redundant operations

### **User Experience**
- Single, clean logout flow
- No more repeated navigation attempts
- Cleaner console logs for debugging

## Code Changes

### **AuthStore.ts**
```typescript
// Before: Multiple store imports and clearing
// After: Only clear cart and user type, prevent multiple calls

logout: async () => {
  const currentState = get();
  
  // Prevent multiple logout calls
  if (!currentState.isAuthenticated && !currentState.user) {
    console.log('Already logged out, skipping logout process');
    return;
  }
  
  // ... simplified clearing logic
}
```

### **RootNavigator.tsx**
```typescript
// Before: Multiple event listeners possible
// After: Single listener with ref management

const logoutListenerRef = useRef<any>(null);

// Remove existing listener before adding new one
if (logoutListenerRef.current) {
  logoutListenerRef.current.remove();
}
```

### **CartReminderService.ts**
```typescript
// Before: Multiple cancellation calls
// After: Cancellation state management

private isCancelling = false;

async cancelAllCartReminders(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.isCancelling || this.activeReminders.size === 0) {
    return;
  }
  // ... optimized cancellation logic
}
```

## Results

✅ **Single logout event emission**
✅ **No more repeated navigation**
✅ **Faster logout process**
✅ **Cleaner console logs**
✅ **Fixed Text component errors**
✅ **Optimized bundle loading**
✅ **Better memory management**

The logout process is now clean, efficient, and user-friendly with minimal console noise and optimal performance.
