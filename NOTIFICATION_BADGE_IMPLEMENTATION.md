# Notification Badge Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of notification badges that correctly display unread notification counts from the backend API for both customer and restaurant interfaces.

## API Response Format
The backend returns unread count in the following format:
```json
{
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": "Resource retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "count": 2
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- Modified `UnreadCountResponse` interface to match the actual API response format
- Changed from `data: number` to `data: { count: number }`

### 2. Fixed Notification Store (`src/stores/shared/notificationStore.ts`)
- Updated `updateUnreadCount` function to correctly extract count from `response.data.count`
- Added error logging for debugging purposes

### 3. Enhanced Unread Count Hook (`src/hooks/shared/useUnreadNotificationCount.ts`)
- Added app state listener to refresh count when app comes to foreground
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added automatic refresh functionality

### 4. Improved Main Notification Hook (`src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`)
- Enhanced mark as read functions to refresh count from server after operations
- Added error handling to ensure count consistency even when operations fail

### 5. Added Test Utilities (`src/utils/notificationTestUtils.ts`)
- Created utility functions for testing notification functionality
- Added validation functions for API response format
- Included logging functions for debugging

## Current Implementation Status

### Customer Interface
- ✅ **HomeHeader Component** (`src/components/customer/HomeHeader.tsx`)
  - Uses `useUnreadNotificationCount` hook
  - Displays `NotificationBadge` with correct count
  - Badge positioned on notification icon in header

### Restaurant Interface
- ✅ **OrdersList Component** (`src/screens/restaurant/orders/OrdersList.tsx`)
  - Uses `useUnreadNotificationCount` hook
  - Displays `NotificationBadge` with correct count
  - Badge positioned on notification bell icon in header

## Key Features

### Automatic Refresh
- Count refreshes when user authenticates
- Count refreshes when app comes to foreground
- Count refreshes after marking notifications as read
- Count refreshes after marking all notifications as read

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Consistent count state even when operations fail
- Detailed error logging for debugging

### Performance
- Efficient hook implementation with proper dependency management
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- App state listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Badge Display Logic
- Badge only shows when `unreadCount > 0`
- Displays actual count up to 99
- Shows "99+" for counts greater than 99
- Positioned consistently across both interfaces

## Testing
Use the test utilities to verify functionality:
```typescript
import { testUnreadCount, logNotificationState } from '@/src/utils/notificationTestUtils';

// Test API response
await testUnreadCount();

// Log current badge state
logNotificationState(unreadCount, isLoading);
```

## API Endpoint
- **GET** `/notifications/unread-count`
- Returns unread notification count for authenticated user
- Response format: `{ status_code: 200, message: string, data: { count: number } }`

## Integration Points
1. **Authentication**: Count fetches automatically when user logs in
2. **App State**: Count refreshes when app becomes active
3. **Notification Actions**: Count updates after read operations
4. **Real-time Updates**: System ready for push notification integration

The notification badge system is now fully implemented and correctly displays the unread count from the backend API for both customer and restaurant users.
